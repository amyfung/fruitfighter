        For the alpha version of the final project, we are aiming to restructure 
        the code to make it more modular. We also hope to add a retry 
        button, pausing functionality, and a favicon. In addition, we will work 
        on styling the game components, adding slicing sounds, a more elaborate b
        ackground, and splitting or exploding animation, if time permits. 

        For the beta version, we hope to complete any unfinished goals from  the alpha 
        version, as well as make improvements based on the feedback we receive
        during our presentation. We may also include different levels or game 
        modes, such as higher levels that involve the fruits moving more quickly 
        or having more fruits be launched at a time. Further ideas include using 
        Bezier curves to make fruits like the apple look more realistic,
        allowing users to save their high scores under a chosen name, letting
        the user choose from different background scenes, and more.
